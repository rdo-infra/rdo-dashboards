      "message": "IIUC, this is totally removing the \"\u003crelease\u003e Packaging\" boxes from the dashboard. I\u0027m not sure about that, i think it\u0027s good to remove the part \"FTBS in:\" info in the boxes but i still see value in knowing how many days have passed since last consistent repository. That info is not in the FTBFS dashboard and it\u0027s good to know. Knowing the current FTBFS and its the date is different, as there may be have been overlapping FTBFS, etc...\n\n@jcapitao, wdyt?\n",

      "message": "So to summarize:\n\n1. Boxes \"X Packaging\": Keep\n2. Info about FTBFS in the packaging boxes: remove\n3. Info abou the days since the last consistent status: maintain and fix if needed\n\nIs this correct?\n\nNote that there is a problem we have found in the past. In the old stable release there may be not new commits for long time. That means the number of days can be high without having FTBFS as the number we are measuring is the number of days since the last update to \"consistent\" status (iirc). If the number of days is \u003e some defined max, it becomes red even if there are no ftbfs. It be good to improve this and maintain the number of days since last consisntent status but check if this is an issue or not.",
